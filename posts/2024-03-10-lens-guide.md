One of the biggest challenges when traveling for photography is choosing the right lenses. The key is finding the balance between weight and image quality.

## What to Consider for Travel Lenses

When selecting lenses for travel, consider these factors:

- **Weight**: You'll be carrying them all day, so lighter is better
- **Focal range**: You need to cover various situations
- **Maximum aperture**: Performance in low light conditions
- **Durability**: They need to withstand different environments

## Recommended Lens Setups

### Minimal Setup (1 Lens)
- **24-70mm f/2.8** or **24-105mm f/4**
- Pros: One lens covers most situations
- Cons: Limited at telephoto and ultra-wide ends

### Standard Setup (2 Lenses)
- **16-35mm f/4** + **70-200mm f/4**
- Pros: Wide to telephoto coverage
- Cons: Added weight

### Prime Setup (Lightweight Focus)
- **35mm f/1.8** + **85mm f/1.8**
- Pros: Lightweight with excellent image quality
- Cons: Less flexible with focal lengths

## Conclusion

There's no single right answer. Choose lenses that match your shooting style and travel goals. If you're just starting out, I recommend beginning with a standard zoom lens like the 24-70mm.
