After a long wait, I finally visited Kyoto. Here's a recap of my week-long journey with my camera.

## Day 1-2: Higashiyama District

The first two days were spent exploring Kyoto's famous Higashiyama district.

- **Kiyomizu-dera**: Visited early morning to avoid crowds
- **Sannenzaka & Ninenzaka**: The traditional streets had an incredible atmosphere
- **Yasaka Shrine**: The lanterns at dusk were beautiful

## Day 3-4: Arashiyama

Arashiyama, famous for its bamboo grove. I woke up at 6 AM to capture the bamboo forest without people.

> Tip: To get clean shots of the Arashiyama bamboo grove, you need to arrive before 7 AM.

## Day 5-6: Fushimi Inari

Fushimi Inari Shrine with its thousands of red torii gates. The round trip to the summit took about 2 hours, but it was absolutely worth it.

## Day 7: Nishiki Market & Gion

On the last day, I enjoyed delicious food at Nishiki Market and waited in Gion hoping to photograph geishas.

Kyoto is truly a paradise for photographers. Next time, I want to visit during cherry blossom season.
