These are the cats I met on Ainoshima, an island in Fukuoka, in the summer of 2023.

## Cat Island

True to its harmless-sounding nickname, Ainoshima in August was peaceful, full of cats, hot, and really, really hot.

Most of the photos show cats exhausted by the hot weather, lying down and trying to sleep.

However, perhaps because so many tourists have come and gone since it became famous as a "cat island," they are not wary of people at all.

In fact, they kept trying to snuggle up, so if you like cats, it would be a delightful experience.

Ainoshima Island is reached by boat from a pier called Shingu Port (新宮漁港) east of Fukuoka. The regular ferry has fixed departure and return times, so you should be careful not to miss the last boat and get stuck on the island.

> It is even said that the return ferry is occasionally canceled due to bad weather.

A quiet, atmospheric island. It felt like it perfectly embodied the Japanese countryside we often imagine.

I remember having lunch at a western-style restaurant named Umi (うみ). Since it's a small island, there aren't many dining options.

But this place was definitely delicious. I still remember the pasta with fresh seafood.

Of course, there was a cat in the restaurant too.

## Site of the Joseon Tongsinsa Guesthouse

Surprisingly, Ainoshima is also a historical site with deep ties to Korea. It is said to have been a mandatory gateway for the Joseon Tongsinsa (peace envoys from Joseon) before entering mainland Honshu, Japan.

At the site where the guesthouse (客館), a house for guests from Joseon, once stood, there is a memorial stone and a map commemorating it.

It's a place I'd love to visit again if I have the chance. The scorching sun and sweltering heat, the smell of the sea, the island village, and the countless cats... Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine myself in that landscape.
