Light is the most important element in photography. In landscape photography, the time of day you shoot can completely transform the mood of your images.

## What is Golden Hour?

Golden hour refers to the period shortly after sunrise and before sunset. During this time, the light has a warm color temperature and comes from a low angle, adding depth and dimension to landscapes.

Typically, golden hour lasts about an hour before and after the sun rises or sets. During this time, shadows are longer, the sky displays rich colors, and the overall feel is soft and warm.

## Tips for Shooting

1. **Scout your location in advance.** Golden hour is short, so visit your shooting location beforehand to plan your composition.

2. **Use a tripod.** Light is limited during this time, which may require slower shutter speeds. A tripod is essential for sharp images.

3. **Check the weather.** Days with some clouds often produce more dramatic skies than completely clear days.

4. **Shoot in RAW format.** This gives you more flexibility in post-processing.

## Don't Miss Blue Hour

Right after golden hour (after sunset) or before (before sunrise), there's a period called "blue hour." The sky turns a deep blue during this time, perfect for city nightscapes or moody landscape photos.
